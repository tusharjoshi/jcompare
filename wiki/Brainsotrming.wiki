#summary Main page for brainstorming.

== There will be two folder paths to start with. ==

We will fill the tree structure with the folder name as the top node and the children of that folder as the child nodes of the root.  The trees will only be filled till here.

Each node from the left tree will be compared with corresponding node of the right tree and flagged with a status

Statuses for files:
 * UNCHECKED
 * SAME
 * OLD
 * NEW
 * ORPHAN

Status for folders:
 * UNCHECKED
 * SAME
 * ORPHAN
 * NEW
 * OLD
 * OLD-NEW
 * OLD-ORPHAN
 * NEW-ORPHANS

There will be a compare tree encompassing the left and right trees and will represent the combined tree.

== Algorithms will be needed for ==

 * Making a combined list of folder contents
 * Comparing the folders and files and flagging states

== Design Process to follow ==
 * Make a use case diagram
 * Component diagram
 * Analysis and class diagram
 * Start coding initial classes
